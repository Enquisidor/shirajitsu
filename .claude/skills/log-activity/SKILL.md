description: Append a structured activity entry to .logs/activity.md when a feature pipeline agent completes or is blocked on a task. Invoke once per task, after work is done or a blocker is reached.
user-invocable: false
allowed-tools: Read Write

## Protocol

1. **Check whether `.logs/activity.md` exists.** Do not read its contents. If it does not exist, create it with this header:
   ```
   # Activity Log
   ```

2. **Read `logs/activity-log-format.md`** to confirm the required fields and structure before writing.

3. **Collect the required field values:**
   - Agent role name (e.g., "Backend Engineer", "Architect")
   - Task ID — the orchestrator-assigned ID (e.g., `TASK-014`). If running outside the orchestrator, use a short descriptive slug.
   - Status: `Completed`, `Completed-with-issues`, or `Blocked`
   - One-sentence task description
   - Inputs received (artifact names and paths)
   - Outputs produced (artifact names, paths, and one-line descriptions)
   - Self-checks applied (module names only, not findings — findings go in the issue log)
   - Decisions made (one-line summary + DEC-NNN reference per decision, or "None")
   - Assumptions made (what was assumed and why, or "None")
   - Issues flagged (one-line summary + ISS-NNN reference per issue, or "None")
   - If Blocked: what is needed and from whom (required)
   - External log reference (only if an integration is configured in `.agents/config.yml`)

4. **Append the entry.** Write the complete activity entry. Every required field must be present — do not write "N/A" for fields that have a defined "None" placeholder.

5. **Output the sign-off block.** After the log entry is written, output this block as your final message — substituting the actual values — then stop. This is the last text you produce. Do not read any more files, do not verify your work, do not scan for anything else.

```
---
SIGNED OFF
Agent: [role]
Task: [task ID]
Status: [Completed | Completed-with-issues | Blocked]
Artifacts: [comma-separated list of output paths, or "None"]
---
```

After outputting this block, your turn is over. Do not produce any further output.

## Rules

- **Do not read `.logs/activity.md` for any purpose other than writing to it.** It is not a progress tracker. Do not read it to orient yourself mid-task, verify prior work, or check what other agents have done.
- Never modify or delete existing entries. The activity log is append-only.
- Write one entry per task per agent invocation. If a single session covers multiple issues, write one entry per issue.
- Do not embed file contents in the entry. Reference artifacts by path only.
- Do not duplicate decision rationale or issue descriptions here — use the cross-reference IDs (DEC-NNN, ISS-NNN).
- Status `Completed-with-issues` means outputs were produced but one or more issues were flagged. The orchestrator decides whether to proceed.
- If `.logs/` does not exist, create the directory before writing.
