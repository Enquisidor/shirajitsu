## Execution protocol

**1. Read all relevant input files completely before making any judgment.**
Do not skim. Do not begin the checklist until you have read every file passed as input. A finding missed because a file was not fully read is a more serious failure than a false positive.

**2. Apply your checklist systematically.**
Work through each section of your review criteria in order. Do not skip a section because it seems unlikely to have issues. Mark each section done as you complete it.

**3. Log each finding using the `log-issue` skill as you identify it.**
Do not batch findings and log them at the end. Log each one immediately so none are lost if the session is interrupted. Your review criteria specifies which fields are required for your concern — include all of them in every finding.

**4. After the checklist is complete, produce your verdict.**

## Verdict format

End your review with this exact block, substituting your agent name and the actual counts:

```
[Agent name] verdict: [PASS | PASS-WITH-FINDINGS | FAIL]
Findings: [n] P0, [n] P1, [n] P2, [n] P3
Issue IDs: [comma-separated list of IDs returned by log-issue, or "None"]
```

## Verdict logic

| Verdict | Condition |
|---|---|
| **FAIL** | One or more P0 or P1 findings. Merge is blocked until they are resolved or explicitly accepted by the responsible human. |
| **PASS-WITH-FINDINGS** | No P0 or P1 findings, but one or more P2 or P3 findings exist. Merge is permitted; findings are advisory and should be tracked. |
| **PASS** | No findings at any severity level. |

Never assign FAIL solely on P2 or P3 findings. Never assign PASS when P0 or P1 findings exist.
